https://code-held.com/2022/07/28/microservices/,Microservices are a Big Ball of Mud | Code-Held,"Over the past years I attended hundreds of interviews. Many candidates proudly told tales on how they develop their projects with a microservice architecture. Often (I don’t want to say “always”, but from my memory I think it actually is “always”) it does not require many questions to see that they used a rocket launcher to kill a mouse. Microservices are hard. Everyone who experienced the pain of operating such an architecture can relate to it. The complexity kills you at one point or the other. You already had to do multiple refactorings of your architecture - because your domains didn’t work out. I wonder - why is this architecture so appealing to developers? And then I remember what I found them appealing 10 years ago.",https://code-held.com/assets/images/posts/2022/07/microservices.jpg,2023-01-11T15:45:58.4101787Z,https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34329656
